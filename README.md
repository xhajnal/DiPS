# DiPS Data-informed Parameter Synthesiser

## A Tool for Data-informed Parameter Synthesis for Discrete-Time Stochastic Processes from Multiple-Property Specifications

DiPS is a tool for parameter synthesis for discrete time Markov chains (DTMCs) against multiple-property specifications provided in Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic (PCTL). 
The probability of satisfaction of each property is constrained by intervals obtained from data. 
For a single property, the existing parameter synthesis tools can compute a rational function over the chain’s parameters, which will evaluate exactly to the satisfaction probability for that single property in the given chain.
DiPS first computes these rational functions for each among the multiple properties by invoking the existing parameter synthesis tools [PRISM](http://www.prismmodelchecker.org) and [Storm](http://www.stormchecker.org/). 

Further, data measurements serve as an experimental estimation of the probability of satisfaction of PCTL formulae.
With intervals derived from the data, DiPS allows to further constrain the rational functions.

Finally, by coupling the obtained rational functions and interval constraints, DiPS implements four distinct methods for exploring which parameters of the
chain are compliant with the data measurements:

 * space refinement - CEGAR like method splitting the parameter space. In each iteration, the result is provided by:
    * SMT solver - [Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3) or [dreal](http://dreal.github.io/)
    * interval arithmetic - [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/)
* space sampling - checking satisfaction of constraints in sampled points, 
* optimisation - searching for least violating parameter point, 
* Bayesian inference (Metropolis-Hastings) - searching for most probable parameter points.



The tool was primarily designed to facilitate flexible and efficient parameter search for stochastic models in computational systems biology, where scarcely available data measurements (e.g. only at the steady-state) can be naturally encoded as multiple-property specifications.
However, the tool is directly applicable to any search problem, where multiple functions over unknown real variables are constrained by real-valued intervals.

## HOW TO INSTALL

The tool was developed and optimised for Win10 and Ubuntu. The tool may not function properly on different operating systems.

### 1. INSTALL DEPENDENCIES:

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.7
    * Windows - just python
    * Ubuntu/Debian - Python header files should also be installed, please use `sudo apt install python3-dev`
    * Fedora/CentOS - Python header files should also be installed, please use `sudo dnf install python3-devel`
* [PRISM](http://www.prismmodelchecker.org) 4.4 or 4.5
* install tkinter library 
  * Windows - already done
  * otherwise go [here](https://tkdocs.com/tutorial/install.html) 
* other missing python packages 
  * in the main directory `MyDiPS` run `pip3 install -v .`
* (Unix, Mac) - install dreal (optional)
  * `pip3 install dreal`
  * build dreal - info [here](https://github.com/dreal/dreal4#how-to-build)
* [Storm](http://www.stormchecker.org/) (optional, advanced) 
* [Prophesy](https://moves.rwth-aachen.de/research/tools/prophesy/) (optional, advanced)

* `properties`: path to [PRISM properties](https://www.prismmodelchecker.org/manual/PropertySpecification/Introduction) eg. `MyDiPS/properties`
* `data`: path to data eg. `MyDiPS/data`
* `results`: path to save results (all the results are saved in the subfolders) eg. `MyDiPS/results`
* `tmp`: path to save temporal/intermidiate files  eg. `MyDiPS/tmp`

Methods

Sampling
* `grid_size` : number of samples per dimension

Refinement
* `max_depth` : maximal number of splits
* `coverage` : proportion of nonwhite area to be reached
* `algorithm` : methods how to choose which region to pick after splitting

## HOW TO RUN

*****
Now you can import the source code as a library or run the tool with GUI.

### Tool
\- open command line in the main DiPS directory (on Win - please open it with admin privileges to ensure changing the PRISM setting does not fail on permission denied)

`>> cd src`

`>> python gui.py`

Graphical User Interface should appear now (With some additional output returned in the command line). 

For fully functional GUI please use screen with resolution
 * minimal 1680x900 (HD+) or higher (all buttons visible but the text may be trimmed) 
 * recommended 1920x1080 (FullHD) or higher (all the features fully visible) 
 
run application in fullscreen and set the scale of the screen to 100%.
